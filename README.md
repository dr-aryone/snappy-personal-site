# Personal Website

This is my personal blog! Just a brief intro to who I am, all my writing, and links to my work profiles. It's built on the below tools:

* Jekyll for static site generation
* Webpack for CSS and JS asset compilation
* Tailwind as a utility CSS framework
* PurgeCSS to remove unneeded Tailwind classes
* Turbolinks for performance
